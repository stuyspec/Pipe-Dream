			<p>The Spectator, founded in 1915, is Stuyvesant High School’s bi-weekly, student-run newspaper. It is independent of any other organization, and as “The Pulse of the Student Body,” is a forum for student expression. It is accessible to all parties and is available at no cost. We need your help to make this paper the best it can be. Ask any staffer and they will tell you: joining <i>The Spectator</i> was one of the best decisions of their High School career.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">News</h3>
				<p>Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Why read all about it when you can write all about it (and potentially have your name in bold on the front page for doing so)? As a staff writer of the News Department, you will be the first to know about everything that goes on at Stuyvesant, and you will get to be the person who conveys that to the rest of the student body. We cover everything from teams winning competitions to teachers being recognized for research to administrators altering school policies to how budget cuts affect our students. You’ ll get to improve your reporting skills as you talk to people inside and outside of the Stuyvesant community, and you’ ll have a chance to better your writing as you learn to deliver the facts in a clear, direct, interesting fashion that News is recognized for. You know what they say – you can’t have a newspaper without the News——so join Spec News!</p>

			<div data-section="sports" class="section-description">
				<h3 class="section-title">Sports</h3>
				<p>The Sports Department covers each of the 37 sports teams at Stuyvesant, including news about individual teams and players, as well as new policies that affect Stuyvesant athletics. However, we also sometimes feature the most important things around the professional sports world. The articles we write range from team previews at the beginning of the season, team updates midway through the season, and finally, season recaps. We also write columns, which are opinion pieces on anything to Stuyvesant sports, or even pressing issues in the professional sports world. Finally, for those more interested in the personal level of the athletics scene, we write features on coaches, players or alumni.</p>

			<div data-section="opinion" class="section-description">
				<h3 class="section-title">Opinions</h3>
				<p>You have all found yourself in that moment where you stood patiently on the escalator, frozen in time, contemplating the realities of your life, Stuyvesant, or the world at large. Perhaps you found yourself angered by school policy or inspired by a novel, or had an urge to mutter a long-winded rant under your breath. The Spectator’s Opinions Department can provide a venue for you to share your thoughts on absolutely any subject matter. Gives you the freedom to write anything from a political argument to an account of a personal, intellectual journey. So, go on. Join Opinions and don’t let all those points of view go unwritten.</p>

				<h3 class="section-title">A&E</h3>
				<p>If you’ve ever read a great book, listened to a breathtaking song, or stopped to take a better look at a striking work of art, you’ve done what we do. As the Spectator’s department of Arts and Entertainment, a lot falls under our jurisdiction. From reviewing the delectable cuisine at events such as the Taste of Tribeca, covering red carpet premiers at the Tribeca Film Festival, and more, our scope is far from narrow. Though we give events in Tribeca priority, our reach spans all over the city. Ultimately, it is our duty to bring the city’s culture to the Stuyvesant community.</p>

			<div data-section="Features" class="section-description">
				<h3 class="section-title">Features</h3>
				<p>The close cousin of News, which covers distinct events, Features covers trends and broader ideas. Profiles of teachers, students, clubs and organizations fall under the umbrella of Features writing, as do investigative reports and coverage of trends in student and faculty opinion. News provides the hard facts, but Features provides the back-story and the analysis, and ultimately aims to give greater insight into the issues that affect Stuyvesant students every day. Writers have great freedom to choose what they want to cover.</p>
